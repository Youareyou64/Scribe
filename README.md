### Features
#### Complete Features
- **Voice Chat Text To Speech (TTS)**
    * Scribe's TTS system can take a text input from a text channel, and speak it into a voice chat.
    * The TTS system uses GTTS for a natural sounding voice, and fast processing.
    * Scribe has a queueing system that allows multiple TTS requests to be processed in sequence.
    
  
- **Voice Chat Recordings**
    * Scribe can record audio from a voice chat for an amount of time, and send the resulting .wav file to a Discord 
    channel.
    * Note that Scribe is currently only able to send files up to ~30 seconds long due to Discord's file size limits, 
    though this is planned to change.
    
    
#### In Progress Features
- **Speech To Text** from Voice Chat audio
    * Scribe will be able to process speech from voice chats into text using Speech Recognition

#### Planned Features
- **Voice Chat Events**
    * This would be a system that allows server moderators to begin an event in a VC,
    and log who joined and left when, as well as gather data about user engagement and participation.
